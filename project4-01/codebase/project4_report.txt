2. Catalog information about Index
- Show what catalog information you store for an index. 
The catalog information stored for an index includes the table name the index is on, the attribute that the index is on, and the name of the index file.


3. Index Nested Loop Join
- Describe how your Index Nested Loop Join works.
The index nested loop join utilizes two iterators where one is an outer iterator and the other acts as the inner iterator that utilizes indexes to find matching tuples. We created a custom tuple builder class to make building the resulting join schemas easier to create. 


4. Implementation Detail
- Have you added your own source file (.cc or .h)?
no

- Have you implemented any features not described in the Project4 pdf? If so, describe them here.
no

- Implementation details to help us understand and grade your code:
The extensions are very similar to the existing code as we simply added an extra catalog table for indexes. In addition we inserted index entries whenever a corresponding index existed for a tuple being inserted. The iterators for the query engine built on top of each other and utllized the filtering of the prior iterators to get the result.


5. Other (optional)
- Freely use this section to tell us about things that are related to the project 4, but not related to the other sections (optional)
